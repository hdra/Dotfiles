Nil Theme
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nil is the dark theme for the overall Nil theme package.  Yes, there's
a light theme -- scroll down if that's what you want.  They're both in
the same repository, though they have different names just to be fancy.

This theme is based on [Raik Ilves's Pseudo OSX
theme](https://github.com/raik/st2-pseudo-osx-theme), which is in turn
based on [Ian Hill's Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-
theme).  Additionally, this theme was inspired by [Liam Cain's Refresh
theme](https://github.com/BoundInCode/st2-refresh-theme), which is also
a variant of Pseudo OSX. So, it's worth noting that Raik's made a pretty
handy base for new themes.I recommend checking out both of them if this
doesn't do it for you (and it's rough around the edges, so it may not).

Overlay scrollbars are kindly borrowed from the default theme.


Ayin Theme
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ayin is the light theme of the Nil theme package.  It features a lot of
grey and arguably softer colors, though should still remain as pseudo-
functional as its dark counterpart.


Color Schemes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Nil theme package comes with the two color schemes seen in the both
the light and dark screenshots respectively:

* `Tubnil.tmTheme` → My personal variation of the Tubster theme for
  TextMate.  This is the dark color scheme.

* `Tubnil Bright.tmTheme` → A variation on the above Tubnil theme for
  folks who like bright color schemes.

* `Big Duo.tmTheme` → Another variation on Tubnil, this time with
  a slightly lighter background color, arguably less intense colors,
  and so on. Cast in the name of god and all that.

Both can be found in the root directory of the package, so to use it
either, simply point your `color_scheme` preference to
`Theme - Nil/Tubnil.tmTheme` or `Theme - Nil/Tubnil Bright.tmTheme`.


Tab Highlights
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to see modified tabs with an orange highlight, you'll need to
enable the `highlight_modified_tabs` setting in your preferences. This
is not enabled by default and the theme does not require it to function,
as such it's an optional thing you can enable that the theme supports if
you choose to make use of it.


Group & Folder Colors
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Ayin and Nil have sidebar label colors for groups and folders.
Either can disabled by setting the two preferences:

    "disable_colored_group_labels": true,   // Disable group colors
    "disable_colored_folder_labels": true,  // Disable folder colors


HDPI Displays
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This theme includes HDPI images for displays that support HDPI on Mac
OS X, such as the recent (as of this writing) MacBook Pro with the
retina display.  Both screenshots above are in HDPI.


Fonts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above screenshots, the font in use is [PragmataPro], designed by
Fabrizio Schiavi. In previous screenshots, the font in use was [Envy Code R],
by Damien Guard. The former is an excellent font, but is not free. The
latter is also an excellent font and free. Neither font ships with this
theme package. My personal preference these days is PragmataPro, but I
had no particular font choice in mind for the theme and the important
thing is that you use what you like.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Package Control

If you have Package Control installed, you simply need to open the
Package Install window and select "Theme - Nil". After that, skip ahead
to the "Activating" section of this README.


#### Installation via Git

You can download or clone the repository into your Sublime Text 2
`Packages` directory. To do this, simply navigate to
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages` (or wherever it
is on your particular operating system) and run the following command:

	git clone git://github.com/nilium/st2-nil-theme.git 'Theme - Nil'

It's **very important** you clone the repository into the `Theme - Nil`
directory otherwise the theme won't locate its assets and will take on
an eldritch appearance. You don't want [Shub-Niggurath][shubby] crawling
out of your screen, so remember, put it in the right directory.

#### Manually Downloading

If you choose to download an archive of this repo from GitHub, you must
rename the extracted folder to `Theme - Nil` and put it in your
`Packages` directory.  That's it -- simple.


Activating
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your `Settings - User` file (hit ⌘, on Mac OS to open it), set the
`"theme"` key to `"Nil.sublime-theme"` or `"Ayin.sublime-theme"`, like
so:

    {
        "theme": "Nil.sublime-theme"
    }

**or**

    {
        "theme": "Ayin.sublime-theme"
    }

Assuming you have then installed it correctly, it should show the theme.
Due to what I assume is settings from previous themes surviving, you may
wish to restart Sublime Text 2 as well, but otherwise you should be good
to go.
