My dotfiles. Setup script based on [this][link].

Note to self:
* No longer in use. I now keep a forked of zprezto instead. 

TODO:
* Separate desktop configs and tools preferences
* More modular setup. There shouldn't be any hardcoded path, especially for .vim and .oh-my-zsh installation.
* Separate .themes and .icons from the repo but still keeping the configuration.
