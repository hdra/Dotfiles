MediterraneanNight for Xfwm
---------------------------

This Xfwm theme is derived heavily from the default Metacity theme. There are
some slight additions, and I've made sure to include some of the features I
think are important in a good, usable window manager theme:

 * Added resize grips at the bottom of the window and each corner.
   The one- or zero-pixel borders many modern themes use for resizing are
   hard to use with Xfwm, so use a NeXTSTEP-like bottom resizer bar instead
   for the Xfwm variant.

 * Maximized windows have their top corner buttons in the screen's corner,
   for Fitts's Law compliance. This should work fine with the default 
   configuration, if you don't have a top panel.

 * Added a subtle one-pixel shadow outline around the window edges. Xfce
   environments don't always have compositing or shadows; in fact these are off
   by default in older distributions. Providing everyone with a better defined
   edge to the window is more important than purity.

 * There's a wide-border variant of the Xfwm theme included as a workaround
   for a cosmetic bug in the X server shipped with Xubuntu 12.10. If you notice
   the side borders of the normal MediterraneanNight have disappeared, or you
   just prefer slightly wider borders, use the MediterraneanNight-wide-border
   theme instead.

You can have the Mac-style jewelled close buttons in Xfwm by applying them to
the Metacity theme in the documented way, then rebuilding the Xfwm theme using
the Makefile in the xfwm4/ subdirectory:

        $ cd $HOME/.themes/MediterraneanNight/xfwm4
        $ make
        $ cd $HOME/.themes/MediterraneanNight-wide-border/xfwm4
        $ make

You'll need imagemagick or graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat for this.
